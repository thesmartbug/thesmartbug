### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are a bunch of Software Developers, DevOps working at different companies as full time, write blogs here at [@thesmartbug](https://thesmartbug.com) share opinions, tutorials, tips and more, which has nothing to do with our Day job as we do not use the same tech stack. The companies we work at, use quite different tech stack for business.

It was started by [@simarmannsingh](https://simarmannsingh.com), and later on amazing folks joined along the way.

We primarily write about technical stuff related to Linux operating system (mainly Ubuntu and Raspberry Pi OS), Java, Kotlin, ELK, SQL/NoSQL Databases like Postgres/MySQL/MariaDB or MongoDB etc.

We're happy to be able to contribute back to the dev community howsoever small that contribution maybe.
If you would want to collaborate with us on some really interesting projects you may have going on, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Happy Coding...
